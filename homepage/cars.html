    <h1>Cars</h1>
    <p>Growing up, I've had a persistent interest in Japanese cars. Most notably, I loved Japanese car manufacturing brands such as Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota. When I was 21 years old, I was able to purchase a Mitsubishi Evolution 7 GTA, which was my dream car at the time. Unfortunately I had to sell that car due to various reasons, and eventually I settled with a Honda Civic.</p>
